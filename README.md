# 不思議の幻想郷CHRONICLE-クロニクル- English-Patch #

### How to install ###

1. Copy the patch and bspatch into the main game's directory.  
(By default the main install directory should be **C:\AQUASTYLE\不思議の幻想郷CHRONICLE -クロニクル-**)

2. Open command prompt and 'cd' to that directory (or hold shift and right-c lick the folder and click "Open command prompt here")  

3. Make a backup of d000.bin (this is absolutely necessary **if you plan on using updated patches in the future**, since you need to re-patch the original file.)

4. Type "bspatch d000.bin d000.bin translation.patch" (without the quotes)

5. Wait until it's done applying

6. Enjoy
